### Info

This project is from Ui.dev's Typescript course. 
The project repo can be found here: https://github.com/uidotdev/typescript-tic-tac-toe

### Project

This project is a "Tic Tac Toe" app. You'll be able to play tic tac toe against yourself and have all of your code type checked by the TypeScript compiler.

You can run this project in the browser by:
1. compiling index.ts with `tsc index.ts`
2. opening index.html in the browser

Note that I only ever developed/tested this project in Chrome.
